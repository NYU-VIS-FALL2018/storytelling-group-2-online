## About
With the recent events of forest wildfires happening across the globe, we decided to dive into data to develop some insights. The goal of the project is to analyze the wildfires in the United States over time and to try to understand the factors causing them, and ultimately increase awareness about climate change.

<b>index.html</b> is the main file containing the visualizations.

## Link to Access the Data
Since the data was greater than 25MB, we could not upload it here. The <b>wildfire.csv</b> data can be obtained at: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eKVGdzMgIRIo8zkNZYcoS_1n4o-8xwf7

<b>wildfire_1.csv</b>: https://drive.google.com/open?id=19w0nyQUt12ZfnGhR-OYz7eL1wjJUO9Ik

## Demo
Since our dataset was too large to upload on GitHub, we were not able to publish the demo via GitHub.

To see the demo, please download the code as is, the wildfire data from the links provided above, place wildfire.csv in the root directory and wildfire_1.csv, wildfire_2.csv in the IV_Project directory, and load index.html (may take a minute or two to load the maps). Thank you!
